# Claude-Resume

### Overview
This project was to create hand-drawn sketches of a resume and then refine the layout in Figma. From there I took my finalized layout and used Claude AI to help generate a final resume for me.


### Tools used
Figma and Claude AI

### Learnings
This was my first time working with Claude. It was really eye-opening to see the power of being able to access the code for the final product. I have worked with code in the past, however, that was a very long time ago, so I am excited to get back into it. In the future, I hope to be able to take the code and bring it into another application so I can edit the code directly instead of having to re-prompt Claude or other gen AI tools to get the results that I want.
